# Challenge-01

I was provided with existing working code for a webpage.

search engine optimization link was not working properly, so i fixed that issue first.

The entire document was lacking a title. figured naming the title after the company's name was a good idea.

backsplash had a link through css and i was unable to add an ALT tag, so i made the backsplash be its own element in
the index.html as a <img> tag that way i was able to add an ALT tag.

changed main content <div> to <section>

changed side content <div> to <aside>

optimized css code by removing classes from divs and simply targeting section and aside elements globally

added comments and ****\*\***** as a separator of code for better readability
